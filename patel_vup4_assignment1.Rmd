## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
install.packages("babynames", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(babynames)
head(babynames)
```
```{r}
babyname_taylor = filter(babynames, name=="Taylor") %>%
group_by(year,sex) %>% summarise(Total=sum(n))
babyname_taylor
head(babyname_taylor)
```
```{r}
#1. Plot the number of male and female babies named Taylor by year
ggplot(babyname_taylor, aes(x =year , y = Total, color = sex)) +
geom_line()
```

```{r}
#2 a) Is a 23-year old named Quinn more likely to be a boy or a girl?
babyname_Quinn_23=filter(babynames, name=="Quinn" & year==(2018-23))%>% select(sex,n)
ggplot(babyname_Quinn_23, aes(sex,n)) +
geom_point()
```
#23-year old named Quinn is more likely to be MALE(boy)

```{r}
#2 b) Is a 6 year old named Quinn more likely to be a boy or a girl?
babyname_Quinn_6=filter(babynames, name=="Quinn" & year==(2018-6))%>% select(sex,n)
ggplot(babyname_Quinn_6, aes(sex,n)) +
geom_point()
```
# 6 year old named Quinn is more likely to be FEMALE(girl)
```{r}
#2 c) What is your best guess as to how old a woman named Susan is?
babyname_Susan=filter(babynames, name=="Susan" & sex=="F")%>%
summarise(age=(2018-year),n)
ggplot(babyname_Susan, aes(x =age , y = n)) +
geom_line()
```
#best guess for woman named susan's age is 62-70 yo

```{r}
#2 d) Find the five most popular female names in the year 2017.
baby_female=filter(babynames, year==2018 & sex=="F")%>% select(name,n) %>% arrange(desc(n))
baby_top5 = baby_female[1:5,]
baby_top5
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
