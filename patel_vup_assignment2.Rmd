*1 Downloaded the dataset on restaurant inspection in csv format from 
    https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j 
Named the file NYRestaurantInspection2023.csv and read that CSV file.*
```{r}
nyc_rest_inspec <- read.csv(file ='/Users/vishwapatel/Downloads/NYRestaurantInspection2023.csv')
```

*(1a) Formed a new data frame restricted to restaurants in Queens with cuisine equal to "Pizza"*
```{r}
#Restaurants in Queens with cuisine equal to "Pizza"
nyc_queens_pizza <- filter(nyc_rest_inspec, BORO == "Queens" & CUISINE.DESCRIPTION =="Pizza")
```
*(1b) What are the 5 most frequently inspected restaurants (use the variable "DBA") in the data frame? *
```{r}
# 5 most Frequently Inspected Pizza Restaurants in Queens
nyc_queens_pizza_frequent <- nyc_queens_pizza %>% group_by(DBA) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(5)
nyc_queens_pizza_frequent
```
*5 most Frequently Inspected Pizza Restaurants in Queens are as above*

```{r}
# 5 most Frequently Inspected Restaurants
nyc_frequent <- nyc_rest_inspec %>% group_by(DBA) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(5)
nyc_frequent
```
*5 most Frequently Inspected Restaurants are as above*

*(1c) On what dates has pizza parlor "SUSANO'S PIZZERIA & RESTAURANT" been inspected? *
```{r}
#Dates on which pizza parlor "SUSANO'S PIZZERIA & RESTAURANT" HAS been inspected
inspec_susano <- nyc_rest_inspec %>% filter(DBA == "SUSANO'S PIZZERIA & RESTAURANT")
inspec_susano$INSPECTION.DATE

gapminder_2007_gini <- read_tsv('/Users/vishwapatel/Downloads/gapminder_2007_gini.tsv')
```

```{r}
#2A
b_plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder_2007_gini) +
          geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(continent, gini, colour = continent)) +
          ggtitle("BOX PLOT 
Comparing the distributions of the Gini coefficient in different continents")
ggplotly()
```

```{r}
#2B
s_plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder_2007_gini) +
          geom_point(aes(gini, lifeExp, colour = continent)) +
          xlab("GINI index") + ylab("Life Expectancy in 2007")
          ggtitle("SCATTERPLOT
showing relationship between the Gini coefficient and life expectancy in 2007, classified by continents")
ggplotly()
```
*From the scatterplot, we can see that there is no clear relationship between the Gini coefficient and life expectancy in 2007, classified by continents. The points are scattered across the plot, with no clear pattern. It appears that other factors, such as economic development and healthcare infrastructure, may have a larger impact on life expectancy.*
