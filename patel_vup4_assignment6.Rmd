## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
#install.packages("tidytext")
library(gutenbergr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
gutenberg_metadata <- gutenberg_metadata
```
## Q1 Find the gutenberg IDs of Treasure Island and Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson using the gutenberg_metadata data frame available in the gutenberg package.
```{r}
treasure_island <- gutenberg_metadata %>% filter(str_detect(gutenberg_metadata$title,"Treasure Island" ) & str_detect(gutenberg_metadata$author, "Stevenson, Robert Louis"))

kidnapped <- gutenberg_metadata %>% filter(str_detect(gutenberg_metadata$title,"Kidnapped" ) & str_detect(gutenberg_metadata$author, "Stevenson, Robert Louis"))
```

```{r}
treasure_island_id <- treasure_island$gutenberg_id
kidnapped_id <- kidnapped$gutenberg_id
```
```{r}
#Gutenberg IDs of Treasure Island and Kidnapped
cat("Gutenberg IDs of Treasure Island: ", treasure_island_id, "\n")
cat("Gutenberg IDs of Kidnapped: ", kidnapped_id, "\n")
```

##Q2 Download the texts of these two books from the gutenberg package.

```{r}
#Download Treasure Island
treasure_island_book <- gutenberg_works(title == "Treasure Island", author == "Stevenson, Robert Louis")[1]
treasure_island_book_text <- gutenberg_download(treasure_island_book$gutenberg_id)

```

```{r}
#Download Kidnapped
kidnapped_book <- gutenberg_works(title == "Kidnapped", author == "Stevenson, Robert Louis")[1]
kidnapped_book_text <- gutenberg_download(kidnapped_book$gutenberg_id)
```

##Q3 Find the 10 most common words (that are not stop words) in each novel.
```{r}
#tokenizing the text
treasure_island_words <- treasure_island_book_text %>% unnest_tokens(word,text)
kidnapped_words <- kidnapped_book_text %>% unnest_tokens(word,text)
```
```{r}
#word counts after removing stop words
treasure_island_filtered_wordcount <- treasure_island_words %>% anti_join(stop_words) %>% count(word,sort=TRUE)
kidnapped_filtered_wordcount <- kidnapped_words %>% anti_join(stop_words) %>% count(word,sort=TRUE)
```

```{r}
#Top 10 words
top10_treasure_island <- treasure_island_filtered_wordcount %>% head(10)
top10_kidnapped <- kidnapped_filtered_wordcount %>% head(10)

cat("TOP 10 words in Treasure Island")
top10_treasure_island$word
cat("TOP 10 words in Kidnapped")
top10_kidnapped$word
```


```{r}
# Combine top100 word counts for both books into a single data frame 
#(used top 50 only for readability purpose: can do for whole dataframe directly using <book>_filtered_wordcount )
top100_treasure_island <- treasure_island_filtered_wordcount %>% head(50)
top100_kidnapped <- kidnapped_filtered_wordcount %>% head(50)


word_counts <- bind_rows(
  mutate(top100_treasure_island, book = "Treasure Island"),
  mutate(top100_kidnapped, book = "Kidnapped")
)

# Calculate proportion of each word in each book
book_word_proportions <- word_counts %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(total_words = sum(n),
         proportion = n / total_words) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create scatterplot of word proportions
proportion_plot <- ggplot(book_word_proportions, aes(x = proportion, y = reorder(word, -proportion), color = book)) +
  geom_point() +
  #scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(x = "Proportion of Non-Stop Words", y = "Word", color = "Book")

ggplotly()
```


```{r}
# Cleaning up to retain only words and removing stop words
frequency <- bind_rows(mutate(treasure_island_words, book = "Treasure Island"),
mutate(kidnapped_words, book = "Kidnapped")) %>% 
mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z]+")) %>% anti_join(stop_words)

# Calculate proportion of words used by both authors
frequency <- frequency %>%
count(book, word) %>% 
group_by(book) %>% 
mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>%
select(-n)
```
```{r}
# Creating separate author columns for comparison
frequency <- frequency %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = "book", values_from = "proportion")

head(frequency,5)
```
### Plotting the proportions of words used in the Treasure Island and Kidnapped
```{r}
cor_plot<-ggplot(frequency, aes(x = `Treasure Island`, y = `Kidnapped`)) +
  geom_abline(color = "red", lty = 2, lwd=2) +
  geom_point(color="blue")+ 
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE) + 
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()

ggplotly()
```

### Correlation between the words in both novels :

```{r}
frequency %>%
filter(!(`Treasure Island`=="NA"|`Kidnapped`=="NA")) %>% 
  select(,2:3) %>%
  cor()
```


##Find two words that appear with a high frequency in Kidnapped but not in Treasure Island. 

### Answer : Words "alan","ye" are one of the many that appear with high frequency in Kidnapped but not in Treasure Island.

##Find two words that appear with a high frequency in Treasure Island but not in Kidnapped.  

### Answer : Words "tom","cap" are one of the many that appear with high frequency in Treasure Island but not in Kidnapped.

##Find two words that appear with high frequency in both novels.

### Answer : Words "time","cried" are the ones that appear with high frequency in both novels.

# Q5 : 

## Find the 10 most common bigrams in Treasure Island that do not include stop words.

```{r}
common_bigrams <- treasure_island_book_text %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  filter(bigram != "NA")%>% 
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>% 
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep=" ") %>% 
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)%>%head(10)

common_bigrams

```

### The 10 most common bigrams in Treasure Island that do not include stop words are : 

### "dr livesey", "ben gunn", "captain smollett", "spy glass", "black dog", "block house", "admiral benbow", "cried silver", "john silver", "log house" 










Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
